# Image Upload Feature Implementation

This document describes the new image upload functionality added to the Products and Customers modules.

## Features Implemented

### 1. File Upload API Endpoint
- **Route**: `POST /api/upload`
- **Controller**: `UploadsController#create`
- **Functionality**: Handles file uploads with validation and returns the uploaded file URL

#### API Features:
- File type validation (images only: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- File size validation (5MB maximum)
- Unique filename generation with timestamp and random string
- Files stored in `public/uploads/` directory
- Returns JSON response with file URL

#### Example Response:
```json
{
  "url": "http://localhost:3000/uploads/product_image_20241201_143000_a1b2c3d4.jpg",
  "filename": "product_image_20241201_143000_a1b2c3d4.jpg",
  "size": 1024000,
  "content_type": "image/jpeg"
}
```

### 2. Product Image Upload

#### Backend Changes:
- Added `image_url` parameter to `product_params` in `ProductsController`
- Added helper methods to `Product` model:
  - `has_image?` - checks if product has an image
  - `image_filename` - extracts filename from image URL

#### Frontend Changes:
- **Form Enhancement** (`app/views/products/_form.html.erb`):
  - Added drag-and-drop image upload area
  - Image preview functionality
  - Progress bar during upload
  - Remove image button
  - Real-time validation and error handling

- **Index View** (`app/views/products/index.html.erb`):
  - Displays product images (40x40px) in the table
  - Falls back to avatar with first letter if no image

- **Show View** (`app/views/products/show.html.erb`):
  - Displays large product image (max 300px height) in dedicated section
  - Only shows image section if product has an image

#### JavaScript Features:
- Async file upload using Fetch API
- Drag and drop support
- File validation (type and size)
- Progress indication
- Success/error notifications
- CSRF token handling

### 3. Customer Image Display

#### Backend Changes:
- `image_url` parameter already existed in `customer_params`
- Added helper methods to `Customer` model:
  - `has_image?` - checks if customer has an image
  - `image_filename` - extracts filename from image URL

#### Frontend Changes:
- **Index View** (`app/views/customers/index.html.erb`):
  - Table view: Shows customer images (40x40px, circular)
  - Card view: Shows customer images (50x50px, circular)
  - Falls back to avatar with first letter if no image

- **Show View** (`app/views/customers/show.html.erb`):
  - Displays customer image (60x60px, circular) in header
  - Falls back to avatar if no image

## Usage Instructions

### For Products:
1. Navigate to Products â†’ New Product or Edit existing product
2. Scroll to the "Product Image" section
3. Either:
   - Click "Browse Files" to select an image
   - Drag and drop an image onto the upload area
4. Wait for upload to complete (progress bar will show)
5. Preview will appear with option to remove
6. Save the product

### For Customers:
- Customer images can be uploaded through the customer form (similar to products)
- Images will automatically display in the customer list and detail views

## File Storage

- Images are stored in `public/uploads/` directory
- Filenames are made unique with timestamp and random string
- Directory structure:
  ```
  public/
    uploads/
      .gitkeep                    # Keeps directory in git
      product_image_20241201_...jpg
      customer_photo_20241201_...png
  ```

## Security Features

- File type validation (only images allowed)
- File size limit (5MB maximum)
- CSRF token protection
- Authentication required for uploads
- Unique filename generation prevents conflicts

## Styling

- Bootstrap-based responsive design
- Drag-and-drop visual feedback
- Progress indicators
- Consistent image sizing across views
- Fallback to letter avatars when no image

## Error Handling

- Client-side validation for file type and size
- Server-side validation with error responses
- User-friendly error notifications
- Graceful fallbacks for missing images

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Image resizing/optimization on upload
- Multiple images per product
- Image gallery view
- Bulk image upload
- Image compression
- Cloud storage integration (AWS S3, etc.)
- Image editing capabilities

## Testing

To test the image upload functionality:
1. Start the Rails server: `rails server`
2. Navigate to Products or Customers
3. Try uploading different image types and sizes
4. Verify images display correctly in list and detail views
5. Test drag-and-drop functionality
6. Test error handling with invalid files

## Dependencies

The implementation uses:
- Rails built-in file upload handling
- Bootstrap for UI components
- Font Awesome for icons
- JavaScript Fetch API for async uploads
- No additional gems required
