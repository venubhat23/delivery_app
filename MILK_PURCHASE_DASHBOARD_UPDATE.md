# Milk Purchase Dashboard Update Implementation

## Overview
Updated the Milk Supply & Analytics dashboard to immediately show **Total Milk Purchased** and **Gross Profit** metrics when new milk purchases are created, including both planned and actual quantities for real-time visibility.

## Problem
Previously, the dashboard only displayed metrics based on completed assignments (`actual_quantity`), meaning new milk purchases wouldn't appear until assignments were manually completed. This resulted in:
- Total Milk Purchased showing 0.0 L even after creating purchases
- Gross Profit showing ₹0 even with planned profitable purchases

## Solution
Enhanced the KPI calculation logic to include both **actual** (completed) and **planned** (pending) quantities and profits.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated KPI Calculations (`app/controllers/milk_analytics_controller.rb`)

#### Enhanced `calculate_main_kpis` method:
- **Total Milk Purchased**: Now includes `actual_quantity` + `planned_quantity` for pending assignments
- **Gross Profit**: Now includes `actual_profit` + `planned_profit` for pending assignments
- **Total Cost/Revenue**: Now includes both actual and planned values

#### Added `calculate_profit_margin_with_planned` method:
- Calculates profit margin including both actual and planned data
- Provides more accurate real-time profit projections

#### Updated `calculate_milk_comparison` method:
- Includes both actual and planned quantities in purchase vs delivery comparison
- Provides better inventory visibility

### 2. Enhanced Dashboard Display (`app/views/milk_analytics/index.html.erb`)

#### Added breakdown indicators:
- **Total Milk Purchased**: Shows "X actual + Y planned" when planned quantities exist
- **Gross Profit**: Shows "₹X actual + ₹Y planned" when planned profits exist
- Uses color coding: green for actual, blue for planned

## How It Works

### Data Flow:
1. **New Milk Purchase Created** → `ProcurementSchedule` record created
2. **Automatic Assignment Generation** → `ProcurementAssignment` records created with `status: 'pending'`
3. **Real-time Dashboard Update** → KPIs include both actual and planned data
4. **Assignment Completion** → When assignments are completed, `actual_quantity` is set, moving from planned to actual

### KPI Calculation Logic:
```ruby
# Total Milk Purchased
actual_quantity = assignments.with_actual_quantity.sum(:actual_quantity)
pending_planned_quantity = assignments.pending.sum(:planned_quantity)
total_milk_purchased = actual_quantity + pending_planned_quantity

# Gross Profit
actual_profit = assignments.sum(&:actual_profit)
pending_planned_profit = assignments.pending.sum { |a| 
  (a.planned_quantity * a.selling_price) - (a.planned_quantity * a.buying_price) 
}
gross_profit = actual_profit + pending_planned_profit
```

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Visibility**: New milk purchases appear instantly in dashboard metrics
2. **Better Planning**: Shows projected profits and quantities before completion
3. **Clear Breakdown**: Visual distinction between actual and planned values
4. **Accurate Projections**: Real-time profit and inventory projections
5. **Enhanced UX**: Users see immediate feedback when creating purchases

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Create a New Milk Purchase**:
   - Navigate to Milk Supply & Analytics
   - Click "New Milk Purchase"
   - Fill in vendor details, quantities, prices, and date range
   - Save the purchase

2. **Verify Dashboard Updates**:
   - Total Milk Purchased should immediately show the planned quantity
   - Gross Profit should immediately show the planned profit
   - Breakdown indicators should show "X planned" values

3. **Complete Assignments**:
   - Navigate to procurement assignments
   - Complete some assignments with actual quantities
   - Verify dashboard shows "X actual + Y planned" breakdown
