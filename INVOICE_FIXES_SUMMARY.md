# Invoice System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Mark as Paid Functionality Not Working

**Problem**: The `mark_as_paid` functionality was causing transaction rollbacks in both sales and purchase invoices.

**Root Cause**: The `mark_as_paid!` method was trying to update `balance_amount` directly, but the `calculate_totals` method (called in `before_save` callback) was overriding this value by recalculating it as `total_amount - amount_paid`.

**Solution**: 
- Modified the `mark_as_paid!` method in both `SalesInvoice` and `PurchaseInvoice` models
- Instead of trying to set `balance_amount` directly, we now:
  1. Set `amount_paid = total_amount`
  2. Set `status = 'paid'`
  3. Set `payment_type`
  4. Let the `calculate_totals` callback automatically calculate the correct `balance_amount`

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/models/sales_invoice.rb` - Fixed `mark_as_paid!` method
- `/app/models/purchase_invoice.rb` - Fixed `mark_as_paid!` method

### 2. Remove Edit Buttons from Invoice Pages

**Problem**: Edit buttons were present on all invoice pages and needed to be removed.

**Solution**: Removed all edit buttons from the following views:

**Sales Invoice Pages**:
- `/app/views/sales_invoices/show.html.erb`:
  - Removed edit button from top action bar
  - Removed edit button from sidebar actions section
- `/app/views/sales_invoices/index.html.erb`:
  - Removed edit button from table view actions
  - Removed edit button from card view actions

**Purchase Invoice Pages**:
- `/app/views/purchase_invoices/show.html.erb`:
  - Removed edit button from top action bar
- `/app/views/purchase_invoices/index.html.erb`:
  - Removed edit button from table actions

## Code Changes Summary

### SalesInvoice Model Changes
```ruby
# Before
def mark_as_paid!(payment_type = 'cash')
  calculate_totals if total_amount.nil? || total_amount.zero?
  save! if changed?
  
  transaction do
    update!(
      status: 'paid',
      amount_paid: total_amount,
      balance_amount: 0,
      payment_type: payment_type
    )
  end
end

# After
def mark_as_paid!(payment_type = 'cash')
  transaction do
    # First update the amount_paid, which will trigger calculate_totals
    self.amount_paid = total_amount
    self.status = 'paid'
    self.payment_type = payment_type
    save!
  end
end
```

### PurchaseInvoice Model Changes
```ruby
# Before
def mark_as_paid!(payment_type = 'cash')
  calculate_totals if total_amount.nil? || total_amount.zero?
  save! if changed?
  
  update!(
    amount_paid: total_amount,
    balance_amount: 0,
    status: 'paid',
    payment_type: payment_type
  )
end

# After
def mark_as_paid!(payment_type = 'cash')
  transaction do
    # First update the amount_paid, which will trigger calculate_totals
    self.amount_paid = total_amount
    self.status = 'paid'
    self.payment_type = payment_type
    save!
  end
end
```

## Testing

The changes should be tested by:

1. **Mark as Paid Functionality**:
   - Navigate to a sales or purchase invoice
   - Click "Mark as Paid" button
   - Verify the invoice status changes to "Paid"
   - Verify the balance amount becomes 0
   - Verify no transaction rollback errors occur

2. **Edit Button Removal**:
   - Navigate to sales invoice index page - verify no edit buttons
   - Navigate to sales invoice show page - verify no edit buttons
   - Navigate to purchase invoice index page - verify no edit buttons
   - Navigate to purchase invoice show page - verify no edit buttons
   - Verify other functionality (view, download PDF, delete) still works

## Notes

- The edit functionality is still available by directly accessing the edit URLs (e.g., `/sales_invoices/1/edit`)
- Only the UI buttons have been removed from the listing and detail pages
- The `calculate_totals` callback ensures data consistency by automatically recalculating the balance amount
