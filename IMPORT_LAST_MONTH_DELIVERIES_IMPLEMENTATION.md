# Import Last Month Deliveries Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the "Import Last Month Deliveries" feature that allows users to import delivery assignments from any previous month to the current month through a modal interface.

## Feature Requirements Implemented

### 1. UI Changes
- **Modified Button**: Updated the "Import Last Month Deliveries" button in the Reschedule sidebar to open a modal popup instead of directly importing
- **Modal Interface**: Added a modal with:
  - Month dropdown (January - December)
  - Year dropdown (2020 - 2030)
  - Import button with loading state
  - Informational content explaining how the feature works

### 2. Backend Implementation
- **New Route**: Added `POST /schedules/import_selected_month` route
- **New Controller Method**: `import_selected_month` in `SchedulesController`
- **Enhanced Date Handling**: Implemented sophisticated date mapping logic

### 3. Date Handling Logic
The implementation correctly handles all specified scenarios:

#### Example 1: July (31 days) → August (31 days)
- ✅ Creates 31 delivery assignments for August (1-31) matching July's schedule exactly

#### Example 2: June (30 days) → July (31 days)
- ✅ Creates 30 delivery assignments (July 1-30) matching June
- ✅ For July 31, uses June 30's assignment details

#### Example 3: July (31 days) → September (30 days)
- ✅ Creates only 30 delivery assignments (Sept 1-30)
- ✅ Skips Sept 31 as it doesn't exist

## Files Modified

### 1. `/app/views/schedules/index.html.erb`
- Updated the Import button to trigger modal
- Added modal HTML structure with month/year dropdowns
- Updated JavaScript to handle modal interactions
- Added CSS styles for the modal

### 2. `/app/controllers/schedules_controller.rb`
- Added `import_selected_month` method
- Implemented date mapping logic for different month lengths
- Added proper error handling and validation

### 3. `/config/routes.rb`
- Added new route: `post :import_selected_month`

## Key Features

### Date Mapping Algorithm
```ruby
(1..target_month_days).each do |target_day|
  source_day = target_day
  
  # If target month has more days than source month, 
  # use the last day of source month for extra days
  if target_day > source_month_days
    source_day = source_month_days
  end
  
  # Find and copy assignments from source_day to target_day
end
```

### Error Handling
- Validates month/year input (1-12 for months, 2020-2030 for years)
- Checks for existing assignments to prevent duplicates
- Provides detailed error messages for failed operations
- Uses database transactions for data consistency

### Assignment Creation
- All new assignments are created with `status: 'pending'`
- Removes schedule associations (sets `delivery_schedule_id` to nil)
- Clears completion and invoice data
- Preserves customer, product, and delivery person relationships

## User Experience
1. User clicks "Import Last Month Deliveries" button
2. Modal opens with month/year selection
3. User selects desired month and year
4. User clicks "Import" button
5. Modal closes and loading state appears
6. Success/error message displays with summary statistics

## Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "summary": {
    "schedules_created": 0,
    "assignments_created": 31,
    "customers_affected": 5,
    "source_month": "July 2025",
    "target_month": "August 2025"
  },
  "errors": []
}
```

## Testing Scenarios
The implementation handles all edge cases:
- ✅ Same number of days (31→31)
- ✅ Source month shorter (30→31)
- ✅ Source month longer (31→30)
- ✅ Leap year considerations
- ✅ Duplicate assignment prevention
- ✅ Error handling for invalid dates

## Technical Notes
- Uses ActiveRecord transactions for data consistency
- Includes proper error handling and rollback mechanisms
- Optimized database queries with includes for associations
- Follows Rails conventions and best practices
- Responsive modal design with Bootstrap 5

## Deployment Notes
- No database migrations required (uses existing tables)
- Compatible with existing delivery assignment structure
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing features
- No additional dependencies required
