# Docker Platform Compatibility Issue - Resolution Summary

## Problem
The Docker build for the Ruby on Rails application was failing due to platform incompatibility in the `Gemfile.lock` file. The lock file was generated on `arm64-darwin-22` (Apple Silicon Mac) but the Docker build environment was `x86_64-linux`, causing bundle install failures.

## Root Cause
- **Original Platform**: `arm64-darwin-22` (Apple Silicon Mac)
- **Target Platform**: `x86_64-linux` (Docker/Linux environment)
- **Specific Issue**: The `pg` gem (PostgreSQL adapter) required native extensions that were platform-specific

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Environment Setup
- **Ruby Version**: Confirmed Ruby 3.2.0 was available via RVM
- **Platform**: Working on `x86_64-linux` environment

### 2. System Dependencies
- **Issue**: Missing PostgreSQL development headers prevented `pg` gem compilation
- **Solution**: Installed `libpq-dev` package:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y libpq-dev
  ```

### 3. Gemfile.lock Regeneration
- **Command**: `bundle install`
- **Result**: Successfully regenerated `Gemfile.lock` for the correct platform
- **Verification**: Platform now shows `x86_64-linux` instead of `arm64-darwin-22`

## Final Status
✅ **Bundle Install**: All 145 gems successfully installed
✅ **Platform Compatibility**: Gemfile.lock now targets `x86_64-linux`
✅ **PostgreSQL Gem**: Successfully compiled with native extensions
✅ **Dependencies**: All Gemfile dependencies satisfied

## Key Gems Installed
- Rails 8.0.2 (full framework)
- pg 1.5.9 (PostgreSQL adapter)
- Twilio-ruby 7.6.3 (SMS functionality)
- Bootstrap 5.3.5 (UI framework)
- Kamal 2.6.1 (deployment tool)
- And 140+ other dependencies

## Docker Build Readiness
The `Gemfile.lock` is now compatible with Linux Docker environments. The Docker build should proceed without platform-related bundle install failures.

## Prevention
To avoid this issue in the future:
1. Generate `Gemfile.lock` on the same platform as the deployment environment
2. Use `bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux` to add multiple platforms
3. Consider using Docker for development to match production environments
