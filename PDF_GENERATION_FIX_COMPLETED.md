# PDF Generation Fix - Completed

## Problem
The Rails application was failing to generate PDFs with the error:
```
PDF generation failed: Bad wkhtmltopdf's path: /usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf
```

## Root Cause
The `wkhtmltopdf` binary was not installed on the server, causing the wicked_pdf gem to fail when trying to generate PDFs from HTML templates.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Installed wkhtmltopdf System Binary
- Downloaded and installed `wkhtmltopdf` version 0.12.6.1 from the official GitHub releases
- Installed required dependencies (`xfonts-75dpi`)
- Verified installation at `/usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf`

### 2. Updated Rails Configuration
Updated `config/initializers/wicked_pdf.rb`:
```ruby
# Before
exe_path: Gem.bin_path('wkhtmltopdf-binary', 'wkhtmltopdf'),

# After  
exe_path: '/usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf',
```

### 3. Installed Additional Fonts
- Installed `fonts-liberation` and `fonts-dejavu-core` packages
- Ensures proper font rendering in generated PDFs

### 4. Verified Xvfb Availability
- Confirmed `xvfb-run` is available for headless PDF generation in production
- Required for the `use_xvfb: true` configuration in production environment

## Testing
- Created and tested a simple HTML to PDF conversion
- Verified wkhtmltopdf is working correctly with version 0.12.6.1
- Confirmed PDF file generation (17KB test file created successfully)

## Files Modified
- `config/initializers/wicked_pdf.rb` - Updated exe_path configuration

## System Dependencies Added
- `wkhtmltopdf` (0.12.6.1)
- `xfonts-75dpi`
- `fonts-liberation`
- `fonts-dejavu-core`

## Next Steps
1. Restart your Rails application server
2. Test the invoice PDF generation functionality
3. Monitor logs for any remaining issues

## Alternative Configuration (Optional)
If you prefer to keep using the gem-based approach, you could:
1. Remove the `wkhtmltopdf-binary` gem from Gemfile
2. Keep the system installation
3. Set `exe_path: nil` to let wicked_pdf find it in PATH

## Production Deployment Notes
- Ensure the same wkhtmltopdf installation is available on all production servers
- The configuration includes production-specific optimizations (Xvfb, disabled JavaScript, etc.)
- Consider adding the installation steps to your deployment scripts or Docker configuration

The PDF generation should now work correctly for your Rails application.
